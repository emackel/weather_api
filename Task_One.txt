1. If I wanted to change the workflow by adding an extra step after the stirring step, but
before the summary, what would I have to do?

In the steps section of the yml file, following the pattern of the previous steps with the step name,
info, substeps, buttons, behaviours etc. Add the new step between the stirring and summary steps. 

then in the flow section of the file, add the new step between the stirring and summary steps in the flow.

If we wanted to add the step in an already in progress dynamic flow we could use the add_step event and the move_step event to add
the new step and move it between the stirring and summary steps.


2. When adding the iced tea mix to the flask, we also want to show the user the target
weight, as defined at the beginning of the workflow. How would you accomplish this?

If we look at the primary section of the weighing step at line 108 we see "Put {{TargetWeight}}
of Ice Tea into the flask and press print".

this {{TargetWeight}} shows the target weight defined at the beginning of the workflow.




3. Regarding the screencast and line 146 of the template: What’s the value of the
“data_point.qty”in that specific example?


data_point.qty represents the Stable Weight. In this specific example the Stable Weight
target weight - delta weight.

10.0g - 0.31g = 9.69g as shown in the demonstration.
9.69g is the value of data_point.qty
 



4. Please explain what happens when the timer runs out on its own vs. when the user stops
the timer manually

As we see from the when block on line 212 containing on_timer_stop and on_timer_complete, when either the timer stops automatically, or 
it stops by user input, the stirrer status is set to 0, turning it off and the substep is complete. On the demostration we see that the 
summary is shown showing the time spent stirring as one of the data points.
